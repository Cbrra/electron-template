# Electron Template

A template to quickly start a new application with Electron, TypeScript, React, Vite, Prettier, TailwindCSS, and Shadcn/ui.
> This is a modified version of https://github.com/electron-vite/electron-vite-react


**Note:**
While Electron is cool, I highly recommend checking out [Tauri](https://tauri.app). It's similar to Electron but offers a much smaller app size, faster startup, better performance, lower RAM usage (as it doesn't rely on Chromium or Node.js), enhanced security, and easy cross-platform packagingâ€”including mobile.

## Usage
- `npm i` -> Download the dependencies
- `npm run dev` -> Start the dev mode
- `npm run test` -> Test the code with Vitest
- `npm run format` -> Format the code with Prettier
- `npm run build` -> Build the app with electron-builder
