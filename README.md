# Electron Template

A template to quickly start a new application with Electron, TypeScript, React, Vite, Prettier, TailwindCSS, and Shadcn/ui.
> This is a modified version of https://github.com/electron-vite/electron-vite-react


**Note:**
As an alternative to Electron, I recommend checking out [Tauri](https://tauri.app).

## Usage
- `npm i` -> Download the dependencies
- `npm run dev` -> Start the dev mode
- `npm run lint` -> Lint with tsc
- `npm run test` -> Test the code with Vitest
- `npm run format` -> Format the code with Prettier
- `npm run build` -> Build the app with electron-builder
